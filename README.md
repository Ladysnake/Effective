## Effective 1.3 - 1.18.2
- Overhauled splashes:
    - Splashes will now be colored depending on the water they originate from
    - Reworked the splash texture to be more fitting with the vanilla Minecraft aesthetic
    - Added a config option to adjust the transparency of the splashes' white rim
- Added ripples on water when it's raining
    - Ripple density can be adjusted or disabled in the config
- Added a config option to control the density or remove flowing water splashing particles
- Added two new config options to adjust cascade sounds volume and distance
- Fixed splashes sometimes being completely black (thanks to lonefelidae16)
- Fixed occasional crashes that could happen randomly (thanks to lonefelidae16)
- Widened the logic to fix splashes sometimes not appearing as well as now taking into account waterlogged blocks (like kelp or seagrass) and not just water source blocks
- Fishing bobbers no longer produce splashes or droplet particles
- Changed config library from Cloth Config to MidnightLib
